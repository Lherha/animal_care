    <h1>Animal Care History</h1>

    <p>Animal protection laws were enacted as early as 1st millennium BCE in India. 
        Several Indian kings have built hospitals for animals, and emperor Ashoka (304-232 BCE) issued orders against hunting and animal slaughter, in line with ahimsa, the doctrine of non-violence.
        In the 13th century CE, Genghis Khan protected wildlife in Mongolia during breeding season (March to October).
    </p>
    <p>Early legislation in the Western world on behalf of animals includes the Ireland Parliament (Thomas Wentworth) "An Act against Plowing by the Tayle, and pulling the Wooll off living Sheep", 1635, and the Massachusetts Colony (Nathaniel Ward) "Off the Bruite Creatures" Liberty 92 and 93 in the "Massachusetts Body of Liberties" of 1641.
    </p>
    <p>In 1776, English clergyman Humphrey Primatt authored A Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy and Sin of Cruelty to Brute Animals, one of the first books published in support of animal welfare.[17][18] Marc Bekoff has noted that "Primatt was largely responsible for bringing animal welfare to the attention of the general public."
    </p>
    <p>Since 1822, when Irish MP Richard Martin brought the "Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822" through Parliament offering protection from cruelty to cattle, horses, and sheep, an animal welfare movement has been active in England. 
        Martin was among the founders of the world's first animal welfare organization, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or SPCA, in 1824. In 1840, Queen Victoria gave the society her blessing, and it became the RSPCA. The society used members' donations to employ a growing network of inspectors, whose job was to identify abusers, gather evidence, and report them to the authorities.
