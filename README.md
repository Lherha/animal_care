# Animal Care Website

Welcome to the Animal Care Website! This website is dedicated to raising awareness about animal care, discussing its history, addressing current issues, and conducting a survey to gather valuable insights. 

## History of Animal Care

Animal care has evolved over centuries, from ancient civilizations' reverence for animals to modern scientific understanding. Throughout history, humans have formed close bonds with animals, serving as companions, working partners, and sources of sustenance. As society progressed, a more ethical and empathetic approach to animal care emerged, promoting their well-being and rights.

## Current Issues in Animal Care

In today's world, animal care faces several challenges:

1. **Animal Welfare:** Ensuring that animals are treated with kindness, provided appropriate living conditions, and protected from cruelty.

2. **Endangered Species:** Protecting and preserving species on the brink of extinction due to habitat loss, poaching, and environmental changes.

3. **Factory Farming:** Addressing concerns related to the intensive farming of animals for mass production of food, which can lead to ethical and environmental problems.

4. **Pet Overpopulation:** Managing the high number of stray and abandoned animals, promoting responsible pet ownership and advocating for spaying/neutering.

5. **Wildlife Conservation:** Working to conserve and protect natural habitats to maintain biodiversity and prevent further loss of wildlife.
