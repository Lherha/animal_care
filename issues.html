    <p>Animal care science is an emerging field that seeks to answer questions raised by the keeping and use of animals, such as whether hens are frustrated when confined in cages,[27] whether the psychological well-being of animals in laboratories can be maintained,[28] and whether zoo animals are stressed by the transport required for international conservation</p>

    <p>There are three major categories:

    <h3 id="farmed">Farmed animals</h3>

    <p>A major concern for the welfare of farmed animals is factory farming in which large numbers of animals are reared in confinement at high stocking densities. 
        Issues include the limited opportunities for natural behaviors, for example, in battery cages, veal and gestation crates, instead producing abnormal behaviors such as tail-biting, cannibalism, and feather pecking, and routine invasive procedures such as beak trimming, castration, and ear notching. 
        More extensive methods of farming, e.g. free range, can also raise welfare concerns such as the mulesing of sheep, predation of stock by wild animals, and biosecurity.
    </p>
    <p>Farmed animals are artificially selected for production parameters which sometimes impinge on the animals' welfare. For example, broiler chickens are bred to be very large to produce the greatest quantity of meat per animal.
        Broilers bred for fast growth have a high incidence of leg deformities because the large breast muscles cause distortions of the developing legs and pelvis, and the birds cannot support their increased body weight. 
        As a consequence, they frequently become lame or suffer from broken legs. The increased body weight also puts a strain on their hearts and lungs, and ascites often develops. 
        In the UK alone, up to 20 million broilers each year die from the stress of catching and transport before reaching the slaughterhouse.</p>
        <p>Another concern about the welfare of farmed animals is the method of slaughter, especially ritual slaughter. While the killing of animals need not necessarily involve suffering, the general public considers that killing an animal reduces its welfare.

    <h3 id="cetaceans">Cetaceans</h3>

    <p>Captive cetaceans are kept for display, research and naval operations. 
        To enhance their welfare, humans feed them fish which are dead, but are disease-free, protect them from predators and injury, monitor their health, and provide activities for behavioral enrichment. 
        Some are kept in lagoons with natural soil and vegetated sides.
        Most are in concrete tanks which are easy to clean, but echo their natural sounds back to them.[36][37] They cannot develop their own social groups, and related cetaceans are typically separated for display and breeding. 
        Military dolphins used in naval operations swim free during operations and training, and return to pens otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>Captive cetaceans are trained to present themselves for blood samples, health exams and noninvasive breath samples above their blow holes.
        Staff can monitor the captives afterwards for signs of infection from the procedure.
    </p>
    <p>Research on wild cetaceans leaves them free to roam and make sounds in their natural habitat, eat live fish, face predators and injury, and form social groups voluntarily. 
        However boat engines of researchers, whale watchers and others add substantial noise to their natural environment, reducing their ability to echolocate and communicate.

    <h3 id="wild">Wild animals</h3>

    <p>In addition to cetaceans, the welfare of other wild animals has also been studied, though to a lesser extent than that of animals in farms. Research in wild animal welfare has two focuses: the welfare of wild animals kept in captivity and the welfare of animals living in the wild. The former has addressed the situation of animals kept both for human use, as in zoos or circuses, or in rehabilitation centers.
        The latter has examined how the welfare of non-domesticated animals living in wild or urban areas are affected by humans or natural factors causing wild animal suffering
    </p>
    <p>Some of the proponents of these views have advocated carrying out conservation efforts in ways that respect the welfare of wild animals, within the framework of the disciplines of compassionate conservation and conservation welfare, while others have argued in favor of improving the welfare of wild animals for the sake of the animals, regardless of whether there are any conservation issues involved at all. 
        The welfare economist Yew-Kwang Ng, in his 1995 "Towards welfare biology: Evolutionary economics of animal consciousness and suffering", proposed welfare biology as a research field to study "living things and their environment with respect to their welfare (defined as net happiness, or enjoyment minus suffering).</p>
